# Thermal Camera with Human Detection and Web App

## Overview
This project involves the development of a thermal camera system capable of detecting human presence, measuring people's temperatures and integrating with a web application for real-time monitoring. The system leverages my custom processing techniques to accurately identify humans in received thermal images - in real-time.

## Features
- **Human Detection**: Utilizes thermal imaging to detect human presence.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides live feed and updates through a web application.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware**: Thermal camera module MLX90640 running on our RPi 3B
- **Software**: Python
- **Web Application**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask

## Achievements
This project was awarded 3rd place in our group projects class, recognizing its innovation and practical application.
